# Data generated and additional visualizations from Pantoja et al. 2022

## Clustering

As mentioned in the paper, the dimensionality reduction is done with __UMAP__ for both visualizing the data (to __2D__) and clustering (to __20D__). The visualizations are used to guide the clustering analysis and are nice to see the final results.

## Generated Data
The data resulting from the clustering for each of the catalogs used is stored in /datasets/datasets.zip

## Visualizations

# Catalina Surveys (CSSCVS)
